# SnakeGame
C++ Snake Game




Algorithm development

Written in  Microsoft visual studio 2012.
This program is written in C++ with SDL library. SDL is a simple cross-platform media library layer that is designed to deliver low and simplistic level access to mouse, audio, keyboard and many more. 

SDL is a cross-platform library supporting windows, Linux, MacOS and much more. It also allows the developer to listen to any events produced from the keyboard. 

This program uses 6 different classes to run the game. Those are: BodyPart, Food, Game, Powerup, PowerupManager and Snake.
The BodyPart class controls the length and size of the snake. It will create and update how long the snake should be with every points earned.

While testing, I haven’t found any problems or runtime errors. But more tests should be done before selling or reproducing the game. 

This program uses 6 different classes to run the game and it wouldn’t be possible without using SDL library. 
This program can be improved by including a system that can save the user name and score after each game ends. This can be done using a text file to save and retrieve the name and score of the current and former users. you can also order them by top score.
